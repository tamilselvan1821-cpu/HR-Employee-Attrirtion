# HR-Employee-Attrirtion
This project analyzes employee attrition using an HR dataset to identify the key factors that influence employees leaving an organization. A Decision Tree classifier is used to build an interpretable machine learning model that helps HR teams understand attrition drivers and make data-driven retention decisions.

# 🎯 Objectives

Analyze employee demographic and job-related data
Identify important factors contributing to employee attrition
Build and evaluate a Decision Tree model for attrition prediction
Visualize decision rules for better interpretability

# 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee information such as:

Age
Gender
Department
Job Role
Monthly Income
Job Satisfaction
Years at Company
Work-Life Balance
Attrition (Target Variable)

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning & Decision Tree modeling

# 🧠 Methodology

Data Loading and Exploration
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Encoding categorical variables
Train-test split
Decision Tree model building
Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
Feature importance analysis

# 📈 Key Insights

Job satisfaction and monthly income significantly impact attrition
Employees with fewer years at the company show higher attrition rates
Decision Tree provides clear rules for understanding employee behavior

# ✅ Results

Built an interpretable Decision Tree model
Achieved good accuracy on test data
Identified critical attrition factors useful for HR decision-making
